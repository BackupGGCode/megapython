"""
HeapSim -- Heap Simulator with Garbage Collector

Attempts to simulate a heap and its garbage collector.
Chunk allocation uses a hybrid best-fit algorithm
with bounded internal fragmentation.
Chunk deallocation puts chunks into four sorted free lists.
Chunk reclamation uses a hybrid mark-sweep
with a lazy sweep option.

Simulation is performed by executing traces of memory transactions
that were output from real program execution.
