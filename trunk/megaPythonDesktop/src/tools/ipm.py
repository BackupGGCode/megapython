"""
==================
Interactive PyMite
==================

An interactive command line that runs on a host computer that is connected
to a target device that is running PyMite.  The host computer compiles the
interactive statement and converts it to a form that PyMite can handle,
sends that over the connection where the target device loads and interprets it.
The target device then packages any result, sends it to the host computer
and the host computer prints the result.
